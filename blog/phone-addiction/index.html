I was a broke freelance journalist traveling for a workshop and needed a place to stay. I found Melanie on CouchSurfing, and she kindly agreed to host me. Back then, mobile data wasn’t really a thing yet, but Wi-Fi was everywhere: open city networks, cafés. Just not in her apartment.</p></div><div><p>Melanie was a young American who had moved to Spain a year earlier. She used to work at Apple, which made her one of the early adopters of the iPhone. She told me how she’d hang out with friends at bars or restaurants, but everyone would just be on their phones. They’d even chat privately about people at the table—as if talking behind their backs, while sitting right next to them. She came to hate that, and eventually banned the internet from her home. The evening I spent with her, she knitted and drew,</p></div><div><p>In the study, the Chinese users ranked among the most addicted. <a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958823000325?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another small</a> study among 180 Chinese university students found they spent on average 5.5 hours a day on their phones. That is more than one third of their waking hours. To put that into perspective: in 2023, the Chinese government <a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/business/china-smartphone-minor-mode.html?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction#:~:text=The%20proposal%20says%20the%20minor,content%20for%20different%20age%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> to limit children younger than 8 to 40 minutes of smartphone time a day, increasing the time limit to two hours daily when adult. That is also roughly how much time I spend on my smartphone.</p></div><div><p>You know what? Let’s get intimate.

But not everone is bothered by it. One student put it this way: “<i>I know that using a smartphone for 6 hours daily is a bit too much [but] since I am so happy when playing on the device, and making changes will be painful, why do I need to control my usage? If the purpose of life is to pursue happiness, smartphones can indeed fulfill my needs.</i>” And honestly, who’s to say they are wrong?</p></div><div id="a-very-persuasive-design"><h2>A very persuasive design</h2></div><div><p>The main reason your phone brings you that hit of joy in the moment is because it’s intentionally designed to trigger your dopamine reward centers. It’s not that the phone is incredibly useful. It’s just incredibly good at creating compulsive behavior.</p></div><div><p>This is called <i>persuasive design</i>, and it’s what Duolingo uses to keep you coming back to your language lessons. But even well-intentioned features, like Facebook’s "like" button, originally meant to spread positivity, ended up fueling also feelings of comparison or envy. In the battle for our attention, platforms deploy all kinds of design tricks to keep us hooked: endless scrolling, endless recommendations, and so on.</p></div><div><p>This is actually also a field of study, called <i>captology.</i> It explores<i> </i>how interactive technologies are built to shape what we believe and how we behave. It observes that we humans respond to computers as though they were well ... humans.</p></div><div><p><a class="link" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/764008.763957?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take a simple slot machine</a> with two animated characters cheering you on every time you win.

In other words, a large chunk of our phone time is spent inside the carefully crafted gardens of <i>Meta</i> and a few others. These apps are packed with persuasive design, and none of them let you opt out of it. I can’t tweak or change how they work. There is no choice. Which makes me believe, that my smartphone isn’t really mine at all.</p></div><div><p>But it could be!

What now?</p></div><div><p>So I sit a little longer. And slowly, ideas start to arrive. I get up and browse the bookcase. I sit at the piano.
