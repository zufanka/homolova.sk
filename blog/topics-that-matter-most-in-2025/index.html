A friend who is a designer and visual artist suggested to make people aware that no piece of information is neutral. A colleague reflected on the power Musk and his army of satellites. And another friend simply said: "Nothing. I can't do anything with the news."¬†</p><p>The conversations were so interensting that I decided to scale it up a bit. At the end of November I tossed a survey into my network and left it cook there for a couple of weeks. This resulted in a fresh batch of <strong>31 answers </strong>to ponder.</p><p>Some topics made an expected appearance. Climate, for instance, was mentioned 11 times accross all the answers. However many responses surprised me. And so I have found myself diving into democracy metrics, world population predictions, duck curves and dark data.</p><p>While putting it all together, it started turning into a bit of a mammoth piece. So, I decided to split it into multiple parts. In this first part, I will discuss the (simple) analysis I used to organize the responses and share the first, albeit unsurprising, category: <strong>world order</strong>.</p><h1>Analysis</h1><p>While the survey was open, I considered using some of the modern and hyped ways to analyse and visualise the data. Should I use an LLM? While browsing the Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a>, I realized that my data were actually little stories, rather than numbers. To make sense of these stories, I needed to approach them with attention and understanding. So, I closed the browser tab full of models and opened the spreadsheet with the responses. Then I spent a few hours ‚Äî and then a few more ‚Äî studying them.</p><p>To introduce some structure, I needed to add a layer abstraction. And my beautiful organic brain indeed proved to be the perfect tool. First, I wrote down a few keywords for each response. Then, I looked for overlaps and recurring themes within these keywords and distilled them into broader categories.</p><p>The categories that came up were ü•Å: <strong>climate &amp; energy, </strong><strong>world order, conflict, information, oneness, demographics, housing, human rights, journalism, </strong>and<strong> trust. </strong>Naturally, there is some overlap between them, but I did my best to extract the most prominent theme from each response to highlight larger trends.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/categories.png" alt="" width="632" height="749" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-xs.png 300w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-sm.png 480w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-md.png 768w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-lg.png 1024w"></figure><p>Below you will find the responses from the first prominent category: <strong>world order</strong>.<strong> </strong>The answers are provided in full, lightly edited, and include some of my own reflections, data and other resources. Enjoy!</p><h2>World order</h2><p>The responses in this category focus on the shifting political climate. They highlight concerns abocut the rise of populist leaders, far-right sentiments, and the changing role of the U.S. They question the direction modern democracies are heading.</p><blockquote><p>¬†1. Europe: European Union, how Europe is becoming more and more right-wing</p></blockquote><p>This observation is simple and straightforward and has some interesting implications. For example, after the Austrian government recently failed to form a coalition, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> noted a "<em>growing difficulty of forming stable governments in European countries [...] where the far right is on the rise but many parties are loath to partner with them</em>.<em>"</em></p><p>I wanted to verify this claim, but the most recent data analysis I found was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053168015622796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 2015.</a> In the process, I came across wondeful data from <a href="https://www.parlgov.org/data-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParlGov</a>, though they unfortunately don't seem to offer an easy way to calculate how long coalition formations take.</p><blockquote><p>2. The democracy is under pressure in Europe, in some countries more than others. In the Netherlands, people generally believe everything is still OK, ¬†but also here the democracy gets weaker and weaker. It would be good to get some relevant data, do some comparisons, pick some interesting examples and raise some awareness on this.¬†</p></blockquote><p>Curious about how democracy is measured, I fired up <a href="/blog/making-internet-search-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecosia search</a> and found an impressive overview of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement"></a><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight leading indexes to measure democracy</a> by Our World in Data. Spending some time exploring their <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Varieties+of+Democracy&amp;Metric=Electoral+democracy&amp;Sub-metric=Main+index&amp;country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive visualisations</a> I began to see that there just might be something to it.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/vdemnetherlands.png" alt="V-Dem index in the Netherlands going down" width="839" height="605" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-xs.png 300w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-sm.png 480w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-md.png 768w, https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-lg.png 1024w"></figure><blockquote><p>3. Totalitarianism in Europe. Totalitarian trends (or fear of totalitarian trends, fear of public unrest, active instrumentalisation of groups in difficult political challenges) overshadow meaningful political discussions on all important topics such as the climate crisis, inequality and polarisation in societies, environmental issues such as pollution with chemicals, plastics and the resulting health crisis... The general wish to maintain a "business as usual" approach in spite of all the above concerns may be among the keys to start covering this challenge.¬†</p></blockquote><p>This response, as I interpret it, suggests focusing on totalitarian trends in Europe to clear the way for discussions about truly pressing issues.</p><p>Three other responses focused on the situation in the US, with Trump and Musk at the wheel.</p><blockquote><p>4. The change in geopolitics brought on by the US elections. With Trump (and Musk) getting into office, we will see a shift of power away from the state to private individuals. In military conflicts, this has already been foreshadowed by the Starlink story in Ukraine and Musk‚Äôs ties to the global far-right. Moreover, capital will become increasingly privatized as the new government aims to unleash anonymous cryptocapitalism. Gradually, governments‚Äô former monetary powers will slip from democratic control.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>5. Trump and how it influences our safety in Europe or the Pacific even (Taiwan)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>6. Broligarchy: how tech and similar bros are broing away rights and broifying politics. The bro approach to business and politics shapes social media algorithms, elections, lobbying and political priorities</p></blockquote><p>('Broing away' is now my new favorite verb!) On a serious note, what fascinates me most about the U.S. situation is how the ultra-rich are taking over politics. Although this is nothing new.</p><p>Chrystia Freeland (then a journalist, now Canada‚Äôs former finance minister) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plutocrats-Rise-Global-Super-Rich-Everyone/dp/1594204098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a book</a> about rising plutocracy already in 2012<em>:</em> "<em>As the people at the very top become ever richer, they have an ever greater ability to tilt the rules of the game in their favor. That power can be hard to resist."</em> And the trend is not going away either. According to data from Altrata, the population of billionaires in the US <a href="https://info.altrata.com/l/311771/2024-11-17/21wbj4/311771/1731871576Li7G5zyb/Altrata_Billionaire_Census_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up by nearly 10%</a> (1,111 people) in 2023. Both US and Europe hold 1/3 of worlds billionaires.</p><p>Recently I came across a fascinating essay in the MacGuffin magazine. Here, the author reflects on the world perception of the ultra-rich: "<em>My main observation is that for individuals born into extreme wealth, it is almost impossible to grasp anything about material or social reality."</em> He continues: <em>"To inherit a condition of unjustifiable wealth means to never experience cause and effect. All external pressures are alleviated by capital: there are no consequences to missing a deadline, to not finishing a project, to dropping out or giving up. It is terrifically difficult to fail, in any normal sense."</em> Trump and Musk are both second generation ultra-rich. I recommend to <a href="https://www.macguffinmagazine.com/stories/macguffin-plutocrat-archipelagos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the whole essay</a>. It's terrifying. Let's just hope it's not such<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/01/02/tech-is-coming-to-washington-prepare-for-a-clash-of-cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">¬†a match made in heaven</a>.</p><blockquote><p>7. Ukraine and and derivative stories such as societal security and preparedness in a new world order, where the climate is also 'attacking' us harder and harder. It is fundamentally about our existence and our way of organizing the world: democracy, equality, diversity - the right to be an independent human being. There is a reason why people fleeing to northern Europe! The refugee flows are not going away from Europe and certainly not away from the northwestern corner. So we do something right here, something other people on this planet wants too. No one flees to the autocracies!</p></blockquote><p>The final answer in this category suggests something intriguing: <em>we are doing something right here</em>.¬†</p><p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">What exactly is it, and how can we preserve it amidst a shifting world order?</p><p>--</p><p><em>Want to to get the rest of the series in your inbox? <a href="https://hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up for my newsletter</a>!</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://homolova.sk/blog/make-search-your-own/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Make search your own!
