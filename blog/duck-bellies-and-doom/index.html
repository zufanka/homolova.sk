(New) Energy Production - Battle between nuclear and renewables. Big tech is investing in nuclear power plants, so won't be long before investors also realize electricity production is a priority.

Electricity can be the more efficient way to power things (e.g. induction stove uses less raw energy than a gas stove). So there has been a push to electrify much of society in the last decade or so (think electric cars. On top of this, and this is probably the bigger thing, is the use and production of AI models requires a lot of power, and big tech are building record amounts of data centres. All of this means that we need much more electricity.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">While there is a lot of traditional renewables (wind, hydro, solar) being added to grids around the world, the intermittency can be annoying since it requires either battery storage, dynamic pricing (so factories will operate at night when its cheaper), or large inter-connectivity (e.g. Spain sells its solar to Netherlands) to flatten out the duck curve (google it).<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">In response to this, big tech in the US have started taking matters into their own hands and are producing the electricity themselves for the big data centres, since they don't want to wait and let the AI trend miss them. For example google is looking into buying and running an old nuclear reactor (three mile island).<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Right now, vast amounts of capital are flowing into the AI boom. I think because the power needed for that is becoming a bottleneck, we will see capital flow into electricity production in the coming years. I think it will be interesting how this capital is spent, since gas and nuclear can give a solid predictable power output, these are desired by data centres, however the public leans towards renewables (usually). I think there will be a bit of a battle between the nuclear camp and the renewable camp over this, with possible more money going towards nuclear in many places. It may also be the case that big tech could say: '"We will only come to places where there are good nuclear reactors with cheap power, since we prefer predictability and profits". This might impact political decisions, and have consequences for some countries like Germany.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">As a side note, there are so many advancements in renewables, especially solar (look into perovskites) that they might be able to just brute force the duck curve with better efficiency.

While the sun is shining, there's a lot of energy coming in, and the need for other energy sources decreases. That's the belly of the duck. And that's good‚Äîfree energy! But it's also problematic because the grid needs electricity at all times. So, once the sun sets and energy demand rises sharply, other sources need to be up and running again. Sudden changes like that can stress the grid. Moreover, you can't just turn off a nuclear plant in the morning and switch it back on in the evening. ¬†<br>¬†¬†<br>This rabbit hole is deep, and I won't dive into it for now. But the more I explore, the more I find it miraculous that in Europe, we have a constant supply of electricity at all times.</p><p dir="auto">That wraps up the first 20 answers my survey.
