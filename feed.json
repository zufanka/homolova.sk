While the recipe is the part you are really interested in, at some point in history recipe pages started to bloat. Now you need to plow through a pile of text and pictures before you can even take a look at  the recipe itself. This additional clutter helps individual recipe pages rank better in search results: \"When I’m writing, I try to tell a story that has a hook as well as please[s] the Google algorithm,\", </span><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/why-are-there-long-stories-on-food-blogs?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=b\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says this food blogger</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But what Google wants to show is not necessarily what everybody wants to read. Such ‘optimisation’ then gives birth to projects like </span><a href=\"https://www.justtherecipe.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">justtherecipe.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - a website and app that only extracts the recipe from any given website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pessimists say that the internet is only going to </span><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get more cluttered</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With the dawn of generative AI, we will swim in more and more low quality content. The internet</span><a href=\"https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will never be the same</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as it was when populated just by us  - the humans. And as much as I love robots, they also produce text that can contradict itself in consecutive sentences;  in a much worse case it can make you</span><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/09/03/ai-written-mushroom-hunting-guides-sold-on-amazon-potentially-deadly/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poison yourself with mushrooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The bots are also capable of making us forget what a baby peacock looks like.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/notalwaysbabypeacock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"921\" height=\"996\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do we search for high quality content in waters made murky by SEO optimization and generative AI? For me a  search engine is like a map, and I have to keep reminding myself that like a map it only ever shows part of the landscape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google has been steadily </span><a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-200901-202409\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">holding about 90%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the search engine market for at least the last 15 years. But the good news is you don’t have to keep on only </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Googling.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The key to any healthy diet is variety. So take my hand into the (expanding) possibilities of searching the web.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/takemyhand-3.jpg\" alt=\"back of my head and an outstretched arm\" width=\"771\" height=\"622\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day I use a couple of different search engines. All of them are designed with a different approach to indexing the web.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword search</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecosia.org/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my default search engine. I use it when I know what I am searching for: company names, people, wikipedia articles, documentation. Under the hood it uses two of the big boys : </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft Bing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The search is therefore still not better than Google, but their business is. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the largest not-for-profit search engine that puts 100% of their revenues into</span><a href=\"https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">planting trees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as search, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also offers a free</span><a href=\"https://www.ecosia.org/chat\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI chat feature</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, based on GPT-3. This one I use for translations and when I need definitions of some terms or phenomena. I also use it for basic recipes, and tweaks for recipes (especially for baking - which I still find mesmerizing).</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not completely out of my system, but I currently use it only when I can not find things via Ecosia. Google is amazingly good at finding out where to buy things online, so I do my infrequent online shopping ventures on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://search.marginalia.nu/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is what I like to see as a serendipity search engine: you never know what you will get. The index is built by Swedish developer, Viktor Löfgren, mostly on grant money (he also has a</span><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/marginalia_nu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">patreon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). It  focuses on “small obscure websites and non-commercial content”, as the author puts it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I love about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that when I searched for a recipe for a crumble, instead of one of the sterile over-optimized recipe pages, I discovered the Kitchen Projects substack, where somebody called Nicola Lamb documents their</span><a href=\"https://kitchenprojects.substack.com/p/plum-crumble-pie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experiments in crumble baking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Next to the recipe, she also shares explanations of how baking with fruit works. If this doesn’t give you warm fuzzy feelings for the internet, I don’t know what will.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments.jpg\" alt=\"Pie thickeners, by Nicola Lamb\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-lg.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pie thickeners, by Nicola Lamb</span></i></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if I am interested in anything related to craft (cooking, basket weaving) or if I feel like online exploration outside the social media ecosystem. Their rainbow</span><a href=\"https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘random’</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> button is perfect for that.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embeddings search</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LLMs are also taking over internet search. There are new search engines that let you chat with the search results and even formulate new questions based on the previous search.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two examples of these are Exa and Perplexity. I have discovered them only recently but use them regularly to discover material around a certain topic for my work related searches. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perplexity</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://perplexity.ai\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perplexity</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lets you chat with the internet. The interface is very user friendly and includes all the search results the robot is basing its answer on. But be careful here, because LLM models do hallucinate and as </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WIRED reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “it falsely claimed that WIRED had reported that a specific police officer in California had committed a crime”. It is therefore more suitable for general overview questions rather than in-depth search.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perplexity </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes you chat with the internet directly, </span><a href=\"https://exa.ai/search\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">returns actual search results first, that you can then chat with if you like, so resembling an actual search engine more closely. It also (automatically) alternates between keyword search and embeddings-based search depending on what you ask. This is a good call, as keyword search is </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less thirsty for resources</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I also like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s focus on using LLMs to return relevant search results.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Premium</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kagi</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kagi.com/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kagi</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the only search engine in the list that you need to pay for - if you want to do more than 100 searches a month. In return they won’t run ads or sell your data. You can personalize their keyword search;  they also offer an AI bot feature where you can choose from a dozen LLMs . </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I don’t have premium access, I use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kagi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sparingly, for the most in depth part of any research. The search results are very good and it helps me find things that I could not find using any of the other search engines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This list is personal, and by no means exhaustive. I for example don’t use the most famous privacy oriented alternative to Google, </span><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DuckDuckGO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There also exists a little army of </span><a href=\"https://www.are.na/elan-kiderman-ullendorff/search-engines-for-wandering\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small ‘folk’ search engine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This list is very much a work in progress and a living active process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet morphs and changes. Looking ahead to 2034 the internet will be at least as different from now as now is different from how things were in 2014. Therefore we need to keep our strategies for navigating it flexible too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have other search engines you use and love? I would love to hear about them!</span></p>",
