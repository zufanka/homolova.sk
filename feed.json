With the dawn of generative AI, the internet </span><a href=\"https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will never be the same</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as when it was populated just by us humans.

And internet search is the most important way we navigate the vast lands of the internet. A search engine is like a map, albeit one that always shows just a select piece of the landscape. Search is so important that it even shapes the internet (and The Verge wrote </span><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a beautiful article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about that).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how to search in between all the advertisement farms and AI generated slob? Can we look beyond the big news websites for interesting articles to read? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is: you don’t have to keep on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Googling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is much more out there!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Take my hand into the expanding lands of internet search.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/takemyhand.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of me from the back holding your hand to come along.\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a daily basis, I use a couple of different search engines. All of them have a different approach to indexing the web and this helps me to think better about what results I actually want to achieve by my searches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet anno 2024 is quite a different animal than it was 10 years ago. Now websites with extensive SEO strategies and big platforms (BBC, Medium, Reddit) are deemed more relevant for search engines like Google or Bing. I therefore like to make an effort to look further.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: The search engines below are just my personal blend to encourage and inspire: Make search your own!</span></i></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia - the default </span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecosia.org/search\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my default search engine. I use it when I know what I am searching for: company names, people, wikipedia articles, documentation. Under the hood it uses two of the big boys : </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft Bing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The search is therefore still not better than Google, but their business model I like. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecosia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a not-for-profit company that puts their revenues into </span><a href=\"https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">planting trees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next to search, they also offer an </span><a href=\"https://www.ecosia.org/chat\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI chat feature</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, based on GPT-3. This one I use for translations and when I need definitions of some term or phenomenon. I also use it for basic recipes, and tweaks for recipes. But for recipes in general, I actually like to use another search engine.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia - the warm</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://search.marginalia.nu/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is what I like to see as a serendipity search engine: you don’t really know what you get. The index is built by a Swedish developer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viktor Löfgren</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on mostly grant money (he also has a </span><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/marginalia_nu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">patreon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and focuses on “small obscure websites and non-commercial content”, as the author writes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I love about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that when I searched for a recipe for a crumble, instead of one of the sterile over-optimized recipe pages, I discovered the Kitchen Projects substack, where somebody called Nicola Lamb documents their </span><a href=\"https://kitchenprojects.substack.com/p/plum-crumble-pie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experiments in crumble baking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Next to the recipe, she also shares explanations of how baking with fruit works. If this doesn’t give you warm fuzzy feelings for the internet, I don’t know what does.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments.jpg\" alt=\"Pie thickeners, by Nicola Lamb\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-lg.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pie thickeners, by Nicola Lamb</span></i></p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marginalia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if I am interested in anything related to craft (cooking, basket weaving) or if I feel like exploring something online, but don’t feel like hanging out on social media. Their rainbow </span><a href=\"https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘random’</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> button is perfect for that.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google - the necessary evil</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not completely out of my system, but I currently use it only when I can not find things via Ecosia. Something where Google shines is finding out where to buy things online, so I do my infrequent online shopping ventures on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa - the new shiny toy</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://exa.ai/search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an LLM based search engine that took on quite the ambitious goal to </span><a href=\"https://exa.ai/blog/announcing-exa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fix the internet search</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I discovered it only recently, but I like it a lot and use it regularly to discover material around a certain topic for my work related searches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also provides something unique is that it lets you chat with the individual search results pages. It also formulates new questions for you to search for based on the current search. One to keep an eye on!</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kagi - the premium</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kagi.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kagi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the only search engine in the list that you need to pay for if you want to do more than 100 searches a month. I therefore keep it as the last option. I do have to admit the search results are very relevant and it helps me find things that I could not find via any of the other search engines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there search engines you use and love? I’m curious to hear!</span></p>",
