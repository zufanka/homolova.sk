                <p>At the end of 2024, I asked some friends and colleagues a question: "Which topic do you think is the most important to write about next year?" I loved these conversations because they took me to unexpected places. So, I posed the same question to people on the internet and received <strong>31 responses</strong>, which I am now sharing with you. <a href="https://homolova.sk/blog/topics-that-matter-most-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In my previous post</a>, I discussed the first seven answers that addressed the new <strong>world order</strong>. Today, I will dive deeper into two other categories: <strong>climate &amp; energy </strong>and <strong>conflict</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Climate</strong> and <strong>conflict</strong> are closely intertwined, as both contribute to vulnerabilities in our societies. As a warm-up for what is coming below, you might want to explore Climate-Conflict-Vulnerability Index and their <a href="httpshttps://climate-conflict.org/www/data-pages/hazards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive world map</a>, which is both beautiful and disturbing to look at.</p>

Beneath each response, I offer my reflections, additional resources, and datasets, hopefully inspiring you to explore further.</p>
<p>I must confess, this post isn't exactly cheerful, but if you hang in there, you'll discover the curious connection between duck bellies and solar power production. </p>
<p>Let's get to it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/12/duck2.webp" alt="duck in a sun hat" width="184" height="184" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/12/responsive/duck2-xs.webp 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/12/responsive/duck2-sm.webp 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/12/responsive/duck2-md.webp 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/12/responsive/duck2-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<h2>Conflict</h2>
<p>To be honest, this category made me feel very uneasy—so uneasy that I didn't want to comment on any of the answers at all. However, as I witness the world becoming a stranger place every day, I'm realizing how important it is that we face these conflicts and consider carefully how we want them to be resolved.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">8. Conflicts around the globe e.g. Ukraine, Gaza, because humanity will erase itself in WW3</p>
<p>This is likely very true. There are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons" target="_blank">12,000 nuclear warheads</a> in the world. Half of them are in the hands of an authoritarian despot, and the other half... well, never mind.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">9. Gaza, because it s the moral defeat and the win of money, capitalism and colonialism.</p>
<p>Gaza is a place that, years from now, we will look back on with the same horror as we do Auschwitz today. The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) has identified <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/israel-palestine-lebanon/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/israel-palestine-lebanon/" target="_blank">Palestine of 2024</a> as the world's most dangerous and violent place. Fortunately, President Trump's administration plans to step in, promising to "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make Gaza Beautiful Again</a>".</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">10. Why are violent cultures are more likely to succeed? Violence throughout history, but also the middle east, and in religion has always led to people becoming apathetic and retreating. See China, see Russia, see Gaza, Afghanistan or Lebanon. In what non-violent ways, can a people or culture win against a violent Regime? Is it possible? For example Falun Gong. Or Kurds. Is it OK to lose ones cultures and identity, if it leads to peace?</p>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">Non-violent actions can indeed topple governments. One of the most significant examples in relatively recent history is the series of mostly peaceful protests that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. More recently, we have witnessed the Arab Spring. So, is it possible? Yes. But how?</p>
</div>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">To refine your nonviolent strategies, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/guide-effective-nonviolent-struggle-2/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/guide-effective-nonviolent-struggle-2/" target="_blank">read the free guidebook</a> published by The International Center for Nonviolent Conflict. The authors delve into strategies, marketing, security, resources, and more. I especially liked the part focusing on pillars of support: civilians, businesses, police, military and other structures that keep the power in place.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  " dir="auto">11. The military upscaling world-wide, especially European countries USA will probably diminish in their role as a deterrent for aggressors on European soil, waking up the EU to take action to be able to fend for themselves in case it's necessary. This may be a good thing, since it would mean less dependency on the US for our safety. But historically, whenever all of Europe decided the best course of action is to increase their military spending, world wars happened. It's a bad sign, or omen, if you will. And something that we should all be following closely the coming year.</p>
</div>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">12. State of the military industrial production in the NATO countries. Russia has switched its industrial output to full military economy. When there is a peace in Ukraine it will take 1 year for Putin to re arm to the state before the war.</p>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">Let's combine insights from two datasets to gain some fresh perspective. First, according to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex" target="_blank">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>, these are the countries that spent the most on the military in 2023. Second: China, India, and Turkey have emerged as Russia's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/russian-foreign-trade-tracker" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/russian-foreign-trade-tracker" target="_blank">most prominent trade partners</a> post-invasion.</p>

<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">What will happen in the future is uncertain. For the newsletter of the Follow The Money Brussels desk, I've visualized the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-vape-lobbying-brussels-follow-the-money-eu-19uwe/?trackingId=1h8LF9LgQJ2WzuguBHCk0g%3D%3D" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-vape-lobbying-brussels-follow-the-money-eu-19uwe/?trackingId=1h8LF9LgQJ2WzuguBHCk0g%3D%3D" target="_blank">projected EU budget for the military</a>. By 2027, it's expected to b e nearly twice as large as it was in 2021.</p>
</div>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">13. The war to end all wars. On principle, we, humanity, want to end all wars but we’ve seen a huge surge in disgustingly violent, ruthless and needless wars. I do hope that a war to end all wars will not be necessary but looks like Others will make that decision and dump it on us to deal with. It might not suffice, though, because the military complex will find more wars to be had. They gotta put food on the table! :) Are we ever getting off of this bloody merry-go-round?</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/year/2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yearly wrap-up</a>, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program concluded that 2023 marked the highest number of active state-based armed conflicts "ever recorded by the UCDP, totaling 59." It seems the time to invest is indeed ripe.  <br>  <br>In October 2024, Citigroup, one of the big four US banks, published <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/money-and-might-financing-the-future-of-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> outlining possible future scenarios and investment opportunities in the defense sector. I found point 3 here especially cynical.</p>

<p>Ok now take a deep breath. Ready for the second tranche of man-made catastrophes? Here we go.</p>
<h2>Climate &amp; Energy</h2>
<div class="el-blockquote">
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">14. Climate, because civilizational collapse is a thing</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">15. I'm an economics journalist – but climate is going to touch everything. The sooner we make the connections the better.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">16. Climate crisis. Why is quite clear: without a livable planet no life.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Half of the answers in this category were very short, yet the topic is incredibly broad.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">17. Climate change is the most pressing issue we're facing right now. And of course this ties in with many other issues: inequality (between and within countries), politics (populism, lack of faith in politicians, growing apathy from voters when talking about politics and policy-making?), (social) media (where do people get their information? how can journalists/writers/... make people care? and how do we avoid depressing people to the point of apathy?)</p>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">I liked this answer because it touches upon a topic that I haven't seen addressed often: the mental health aspects of climate change. On one hand we are dealing with mental health issues associated with extreme weather events: PTSD, trauma.</p>
</div>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">We also deal with something called <strong>solastalgia</strong>: the distress that comes from environmental changes around our home environment, combined with a sense of powerlessness over these changes. The word comes from the Latin <em>sōlācium</em> (solace or comfort), <em>solus</em> (desolation), and the Greek <em>algia</em> (pain, suffering, grief). It reminds me of the disappearance of snow in winter, but for others, it will be more severe.</p>

<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">Although data on all of this is scarce, I came across a 2021 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext" target="_blank">study that surveyed 10,000 people</a> between 16 and 25 years of age from all continents.

<p class="msg msg--highlight " dir="auto">18. The energy transition. The news in 2024 has largely, and understandably, been captured by politics, and it has been ages that climate change has been front and center. I am afraid, that is partly because climate change lives in people's minds as yet another disaster we don't want to think about, which is why I think that stories about the energy transition can be a force for good. It's happening, amazing strides are being made, and it builds a future that we want to live in if we pull it off.</p>

Initially, the bot said, "The energy transition is not on track, and the situation is likely to worsen without significant changes." This made me properly sad, so I asked if they could find me some hopeful news. Luckily, they could. "The message is clear: we are making substantial progress in the global energy transition, and there's genuine hope for a sustainable, clean energy future." That made me feel better. Who said hallucinations were a bug?</p>

<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">20. (New) Energy Production - Battle between nuclear and renewables. Big tech is investing in nuclear power plants, so won't be long before investors also realize electricity production is a priority. This could buck the renewables trend.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">So basically society always needs more energy. Electricity can be the more efficient way to power things (e.g. induction stove uses less raw energy than a gas stove). So there has been a push to electrify much of society in the last decade or so (think electric cars. On top of this, and this is probably the bigger thing, is the use and production of AI models requires a lot of power, and big tech are building record amounts of data centres. All of this means that we need much more electricity.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">While there is a lot of traditional renewables (wind, hydro, solar) being added to grids around the world, the intermittency can be annoying since it requires either battery storage, dynamic pricing (so factories will operate at night when its cheaper), or large inter-connectivity (e.g. Spain sells its solar to Netherlands) to flatten out the duck curve (google it).<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">In response to this, big tech in the US have started taking matters into their own hands and are producing the electricity themselves for the big data centres, since they don't want to wait and let the AI trend miss them. For example google is looking into buying and running an old nuclear reactor (three mile island).<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Right now, vast amounts of capital are flowing into the AI boom. I think because the power needed for that is becoming a bottleneck, we will see capital flow into electricity production in the coming years. I think it will be interesting how this capital is spent, since gas and nuclear can give a solid predictable power output, these are desired by data centres, however the public leans towards renewables (usually). I think there will be a bit of a battle between the nuclear camp and the renewable camp over this, with possible more money going towards nuclear in many places. It may also be the case that big tech could say: '"We will only come to places where there are good nuclear reactors with cheap power, since we prefer predictability and profits". This might impact political decisions, and have consequences for some countries like Germany.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">As a side note, there are so many advancements in renewables, especially solar (look into perovskites) that they might be able to just brute force the duck curve with better efficiency. Also large inter-connectors are being built, and studies have shown trading electricity over large distances like Spain and Netherlands can allow both places to use renewables longer.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Anyway, caffeine rant over.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Some sources/ Youtube channels: </span><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16203Tks_0I" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16203Tks_0I" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">this topic</a><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, </span><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1C36SQcqo&amp;t=619s" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1C36SQcqo&amp;t=619s" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">good channel for renewable tech updates</a><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> , </span><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1ecjYFYTo" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1ecjYFYTo" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">nuclear could get smaller/ cheaper</a><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, </span><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@UndecidedMF" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@UndecidedMF" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">also a good channel</a><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, </span><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13jZ9qHJ5U" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13jZ9qHJ5U" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">this guy is amazing</a></p>

<div>See the orange li￼ne? While the sun is shining, there's a lot of energy coming in, and the need for other energy sources decreases. That's the belly of the duck. And that's good—free energy! But it's also problematic because the grid needs electricity at all times. So, once the sun sets and energy demand rises sharply, other sources need to be up and running again. Sudden changes like that can stress the grid. Moreover, you can't just turn off a nuclear plant in the morning and switch it back on in the evening.  <br>  <br>This rabbit hole is deep, and I won't dive into it for now. But the more I explore, the more I find it miraculous that in Europe, we have a constant supply of electricity at all times.</div>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/zufanka_Broligarchy_how_tech_and_similar_bros_are_broing_away_4a39518c-15c9-4399-949a-c96b6c77cc3b_1.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Two men dressed in suits and sunglasses, sitting back-to-back on an ornate bench, each engrossed in using a tablet." /></p>
                <p>At the end of 2024, I asked a some friends and colleagues a question: "Which topic do you think is the most important to write about next year?" and got some very diverse answers. A friend who is a designer and visual artist suggested to make people aware that no piece of information is neutral. A colleague reflected on the power of Musk and his army of satellites. And another friend simply said: "Nothing. I can't do anything with the news." </p>
<p>The conversations were so interensting that I decided to scale it up. At the end of November I tossed a survey into my network and let it cook there for a couple of weeks. This resulted in a fresh batch of <strong>31 answers </strong>to ponder.</p>
<p>Some topics made an expected appearance. Climate, for instance, was mentioned 11 times accross all the answers. However many responses surprised me. And so I have found myself diving into democracy metrics, world population predictions, duck curves and dark data.</p>
<p>While putting all the answers together to share with you, it started turning into a bit of a mammoth piece. So, I decided to split it into multiple parts. In the upcoming weeks I will write multiple posts. In each of them I will unpack several of the responses, divided into categories (more on those below).</p>
<p>In this first part, I will discuss the (simple) analysis I used to organize the responses and share the first, albeit unsurprising, category: <strong>world order</strong>.</p>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>While the survey was open, I considered using some of the modern and hyped ways to analyse and visualise the data. Should I use an LLM? While browsing the Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a>, I realized that my data were actually little stories, rather than numbers. And that to make sense of these stories, it was better to approach them with attention and understanding. So, I closed the browser tab full of models and opened the spreadsheet with the responses. Then I spent a few hours — and then a few more — studying them.</p>
<p>Even if not using any fancy statstics, I wanted to introduce some structure. My beautiful organic brain proved to be the perfect tool for this. First I wrote down a few keywords for each response. Then, I looked for overlaps and recurring themes within these keywords and distilled them into broader categories. In practice, I added two columns next to the responses, which looked something like this:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;"><strong>keywords</strong></td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;"><strong>category</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">war, military upscaling, changing role of the USA, national security, war</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">conflict</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">climate, technology impacts, energy requirements</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">climate &amp; energy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">positive news, rethinking journalism, positive trends, positive outlook, diversity of opinions</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">journalism</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The categories that came up in the end were 🥁: <strong>climate &amp; energy, </strong><strong>world order, conflict, information, oneness, demographics, housing, human rights, journalism, </strong>and<strong> trust. </strong>Naturally, there is some overlap between them, but I did my best to extract the most prominent theme from each response to highlight larger trends.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/categories.png" alt="" width="632" height="749" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p>Below you will find the responses from the first prominent category: <strong>world order</strong>.<strong> </strong>The answers are provided in full, lightly edited, and include some of my own reflections, data and other resources. Enjoy!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/bro1-2.png" alt="" width="137" height="112" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<h2>World order</h2>
<p>The responses in this category focus on the shifting political climate. They highlight concerns about the rise of populist leaders, far-right sentiments, and the changing role of the U.S. They question the direction modern democracies are heading.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">2. The democracy is under pressure in Europe, in some countries more than others. In the Netherlands, people generally believe everything is still OK,  but also here the democracy gets weaker and weaker. It would be good to get some relevant data, do some comparisons, pick some interesting examples and raise some awareness on this. 1. Europe: European Union, how Europe is becoming more and more right-wing</span></p>
<p>This observation is simple and straightforward and has some interesting implications. For example, after the Austrian government recently failed to form a coalition, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> noted a "<em>growing difficulty of forming stable governments in European countries [...] where the far right is on the rise but many parties are loath to partner with them</em>.<em>"</em></p>
<p>I wanted to verify this claim, but the most recent data analysis I found was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053168015622796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 2015.</a> In the process, I came across wondeful data from <a href="https://www.parlgov.org/data-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParlGov</a>, though they unfortunately don't seem to offer an easy way to calculate how long coalition formations take.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">2. The democracy is under pressure in Europe, in some countries more than others. In the Netherlands, people generally believe everything is still OK,  but also here the democracy gets weaker and weaker. It would be good to get some relevant data, do some comparisons, pick some interesting examples and raise some awareness on this. </span></p>
<p>Curious about how democracy is measured, I fired up <a href="/blog/making-internet-search-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecosia search</a> and found an impressive overview of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement"></a><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight leading indexes to measure democracy</a> by Our World in Data. Spending some time exploring their <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Varieties+of+Democracy&amp;Metric=Electoral+democracy&amp;Sub-metric=Main+index&amp;country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive visualisations</a> I began to see that there just might be something to it. See below the Varieties of democracy index for the Netherlands. Similarly, their <a href="https://v-dem.net/documents/43/v-dem_dr2024_lowres.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> is not very uplifting: "<em>Almost all components of democracy are getting worse in more countries than they are getting  better, compared to ten years ago."</em></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/vdemnetherlands.png" alt="V-Dem index in the Netherlands going down" width="839" height="605" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">3. Totalitarianism in Europe. Totalitarian trends (or fear of totalitarian trends, fear of public unrest, active instrumentalisation of groups in difficult political challenges) overshadow meaningful political discussions on all important topics such as the climate crisis, inequality and polarisation in societies, environmental issues such as pollution with chemicals, plastics and the resulting health crisis... The general wish to maintain a "business as usual" approach in spite of all the above concerns may be among the keys to start covering this challenge. </span></p>
<p>This response, as I interpret it, suggests focusing on totalitarian trends in Europe to clear the way for discussions about truly pressing issues.</p>
<p>Three other responses focused on the situation in the US, with Trump and Musk at the wheel.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">4. The change in geopolitics brought on by the US elections. With Trump (and Musk) getting into office, we will see a shift of power away from the state to private individuals. In military conflicts, this has already been foreshadowed by the Starlink story in Ukraine and Musk’s ties to the global far-right. Moreover, capital will become increasingly privatized as the new government aims to unleash anonymous cryptocapitalism. Gradually, governments’ former monetary powers will slip from democratic control.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">5. Trump and how it influences our safety in Europe or the Pacific even (Taiwan)=</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">6. Broligarchy: how tech and similar bros are broing away rights and broifying politics. The bro approach to business and politics shapes social media algorithms, elections, lobbying and political priorities</span></p>
<p>('Broing away' is now my new favorite verb!) On a serious note, what fascinates me most about the U.S. situation is how the ultra-rich are taking over politics. Although this is nothing new.</p>
<p>Chrystia Freeland (then a journalist, now Canada’s former finance minister) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plutocrats-Rise-Global-Super-Rich-Everyone/dp/1594204098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a book</a> about rising plutocracy already in 2012<em>:</em> "<em>As the people at the very top become ever richer, they have an ever greater ability to tilt the rules of the game in their favor. That power can be hard to resist."</em> And the trend is not going away either. According to data from Altrata, the population of billionaires in the US <a href="https://info.altrata.com/l/311771/2024-11-17/21wbj4/311771/1731871576Li7G5zyb/Altrata_Billionaire_Census_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up by nearly 10%</a> (1,111 people) in 2023. Both US and Europe hold 1/3 of worlds billionaires.</p>
<p>Recently I came across a fascinating essay in the MacGuffin magazine. Here, the author reflects on the world perception of the ultra-rich: "<em>My main observation is that for individuals born into extreme wealth, it is almost impossible to grasp anything about material or social reality."</em> He continues: <em>"To inherit a condition of unjustifiable wealth means to never experience cause and effect. All external pressures are alleviated by capital: there are no consequences to missing a deadline, to not finishing a project, to dropping out or giving up. It is terrifically difficult to fail, in any normal sense."</em> Trump and Musk are both second generation ultra-rich. I recommend to <a href="https://www.macguffinmagazine.com/stories/macguffin-plutocrat-archipelagos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the whole essay</a>. It's terrifying. Let's just hope it's not such<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/01/02/tech-is-coming-to-washington-prepare-for-a-clash-of-cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a match made in heaven</a>.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">7. Ukraine and and derivative stories such as societal security and preparedness in a new world order, where the climate is also 'attacking' us harder and harder. It is fundamentally about our existence and our way of organizing the world: democracy, equality, diversity - the right to be an independent human being. There is a reason why people fleeing to northern Europe! The refugee flows are not going away from Europe and certainly not away from the northwestern corner. So we do something right here, something other people on this planet wants too. No one flees to the autocracies!</span></p>
<p>The final answer in this category suggests something intriguing: <em>we are doing something right here</em>. </p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">What exactly is it, and how can we preserve it amidst a shifting world order?</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet search sucks. It's not just my personal opinion.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/googleisgettingworse.png" alt="screenshots of articles about google getting worse" width="1200" height="1200" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don't trust the media, maybe you do trust the Germans: their university researchers came to the same sad conclusion </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“that higher-ranked pages are on average more optimized, more monetized [...] and they show signs of lower text quality”, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reads their recent</span><a href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you recognize this from recipe websites. While the recipe is the part you are really interested in, at some point in history recipe pages started to bloat. Now you need to plow through a pile of text and pictures before you can even take a look at  the recipe itself. This additional clutter helps individual recipe pages rank better in search results: "When I’m writing, I try to tell a story that has a hook as well as please[s] the Google algorithm,", </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-are-there-long-stories-on-food-blogs?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says this food blogger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But what Google wants to show is not necessarily what everybody wants to read. Such ‘optimisation’ then gives birth to projects like </span><a href="https://www.justtherecipe.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">justtherecipe.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - a website and app that only extracts the recipe from any given website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pessimists say that the internet is only going to </span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get more cluttered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the dawn of generative AI, we will swim in more and more low quality content. The internet</span><a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will never be the same</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it was when populated just by us  - the humans. And as much as I love robots, they also produce text that can contradict itself in consecutive sentences;  in a much worse case it can make you</span><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/03/ai-written-mushroom-hunting-guides-sold-on-amazon-potentially-deadly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poison yourself with mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bots are also capable of making us forget what a baby peacock looks like.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/notalwaysbabypeacock.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="996" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we search for high quality content in waters made murky by SEO optimization and generative AI? For me a  search engine is like a map, and I have to keep reminding myself that like a map it only ever shows part of the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has been steadily </span><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-200901-202409"><span style="font-weight: 400;">holding about 90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the search engine market for at least the last 15 years. But the good news is you don’t have to keep on only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Googling.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The key to any healthy diet is variety. So take my hand into the (expanding) possibilities of searching the web.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/takemyhand-3.jpg" alt="back of my head and an outstretched arm" width="771" height="622" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/takemyhand-3-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day I use a couple of different search engines. All of them are designed with a different approach to indexing the web.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword search</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is my default search engine. I use it when I know what I am searching for: company names, people, wikipedia articles, documentation. Under the hood it uses two of the big boys : </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Bing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The search is therefore still not better than Google, but their business is. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the largest not-for-profit search engine that puts 100% of their revenues into</span><a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">planting trees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as search, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also offers a free</span><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/chat"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI chat feature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based on GPT-3. This one I use for translations and when I need definitions of some terms or phenomena. I also use it for basic recipes, and tweaks for recipes (especially for baking - which I still find mesmerizing).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not completely out of my system, but I currently use it only when I can not find things via Ecosia. Google is amazingly good at finding out where to buy things online, so I do my infrequent online shopping ventures on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is what I like to see as a serendipity search engine: you never know what you will get. The index is built by Swedish developer, Viktor Löfgren, mostly on grant money (he also has a</span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/marginalia_nu"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">patreon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It  focuses on “small obscure websites and non-commercial content”, as the author puts it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I love about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that when I searched for a recipe for a crumble, instead of one of the sterile over-optimized recipe pages, I discovered the Kitchen Projects substack, where somebody called Nicola Lamb documents their</span><a href="https://kitchenprojects.substack.com/p/plum-crumble-pie"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiments in crumble baking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next to the recipe, she also shares explanations of how baking with fruit works. If this doesn’t give you warm fuzzy feelings for the internet, I don’t know what will.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments.jpg" alt="Pie thickeners, by Nicola Lamb" width="1200" height="1600" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/nicolalammcrumbleexperiments-lg.jpg 1024w"><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if I am interested in anything related to craft (cooking, basket weaving) or if I feel like online exploration outside the social media ecosystem. Their rainbow</span><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘random’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button is perfect for that.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embeddings search</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLMs are also taking over internet search. There are new search engines that let you chat with the search results and even formulate new questions based on the previous search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two examples of these are Exa and Perplexity. I have discovered them only recently but use them regularly to discover material around a certain topic for my work related searches. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perplexity</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://perplexity.ai"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perplexity</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you chat with the internet. The interface is very user friendly and includes all the search results the robot is basing its answer on. But be careful here, because LLM models do hallucinate and as </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIRED reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “it falsely claimed that WIRED had reported that a specific police officer in California had committed a crime”. It is therefore more suitable for general overview questions rather than in-depth search.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">perplexity </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes you chat with the internet directly, </span><a href="https://exa.ai/search"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">returns actual search results first, that you can then chat with if you like, so resembling an actual search engine more closely. It also (automatically) alternates between keyword search and embeddings-based search depending on what you ask. This is a good call, as keyword search is </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less thirsty for resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I also like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s focus on using LLMs to return relevant search results.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://kagi.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only search engine in the list that you need to pay for - if you want to do more than 100 searches a month. In return they won’t run ads or sell your data. You can personalize their keyword search;  they also offer an AI bot feature where you can choose from a dozen LLMs . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I don’t have premium access, I use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sparingly, for the most in depth part of any research. The search results are very good and it helps me find things that I could not find using any of the other search engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is personal, and by no means exhaustive. I for example don’t use the most famous privacy oriented alternative to Google, </span><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuckDuckGO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There also exists a little army of </span><a href="https://www.are.na/elan-kiderman-ullendorff/search-engines-for-wandering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small ‘folk’ search engine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is very much a work in progress and a living active process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet morphs and changes. Looking ahead to 2034 the internet will be at least as different from now as now is different from how things were in 2014. Therefore we need to keep our strategies for navigating it flexible too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have other search engines you use and love? I would love to hear about them!</span></p>
