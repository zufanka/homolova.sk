    It all started when the squirrel woke up with an unusually cold nose. It slowly unfurled from its nest of dried moss and leaves, then hopped onto the nearest tree branch. The air smelled crisp, and a soft mist hung low in the morning forest.

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">It’s autumn. The elation of summer dissolves, the air cools, and the trees burst into color. It’s the season for staying in, wearing warm socks, and savoring pumpkin stews.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I am a child of autumn, born on a dark November night. I love this colorful transition into introspection and calm. Most of my creative work happens in autumn, when I’m still carried by the energy of summer, but drawn by the weather to build a cozy den indoors.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">This essay is all about autumn, but of a different kind: the autumn of the menstrual cycle. And before you click this essay away because you think it doesn’t concern you, I invite you to stay. You might be surprised by how much of it does.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The monthly cycle in childbearing bodies has its own seasons, similar to the ones we see in nature. Bleeding is winter, when the body is at its weakest and craves rest above all. As the bleeding stops, spring arrives and with it energy is returning. Then comes summer, peaking with ovulation. Ovulation ushers in the luteal phase, the inner autumn, when energy turns inward again, preparing the body and mind for winter’s stillness.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Though half of the population experiences this cycle twelve times a year, it remains shrouded in taboo, shame, and misunderstanding. Our society often speaks of the premenstrual phase, the inner autumn, only in terms of discomfort: mood swings, irritability, anxiety, fatigue, bloating, tenderness, headaches.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">For much of my life, I too saw this time only through tension, tears, and sugar cravings. But lately, I’ve begun to fall in love with it. Just as no season is less magical than another, every part of this inner cycle too carries its own beauty.</span></p>

<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">What actually happens during the menstrual cycle? Very technically said, it's a fluctuation of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. These hormonal waves divide the cycle into two main phases of roughly equal length: the follicular and the luteal phases. Ovulation and menstruation mark the transitions between them.</span></p>

<div class="_1gaxnt60">
<p><span class="hxnnnr0">Schematic overview of the menstrual cycle; individual cycles differ widely</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The follicular phase begins with the shedding of the uterine lining (bleeding) and the maturation of a new egg. After about two weeks, the egg is released and descends toward the uterus, ready to become a new human. This phase is estrogen-dominant.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Estrogen brings a boost of dopamine and serotonin. During this time, I might feel more energetic, social, and outwardly focused. My body often feels stronger too. The follicular phase carries the bright, expansive energy of spring and summer.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">After ovulation, estrogen drops, progesterone begins to rise, and the luteal phase starts. Progesterone helps thicken the uterine lining in case a fertilized egg arrives. If pregnancy occurs, progesterone continues to rise, nurturing the tiny human and stimulating the milk glands in the breasts. If there’s no fertilized egg, progesterone levels fall, the uterine lining is shed, and the show starts again.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In the luteal phase I might be lower in energy, calmer, slower, introspective, more intraverted, conserving energy for the coming winter.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The late luteal phase is infamous. Its effects are collectively known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome), or in a more severe form, PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Neither is pleasant, and both often manifest in the emotional realm by irritability, sadness, anger, or a general heaviness.</span></p>

<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Why does this happen? There isn’t one clear answer.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Some studies point to the drop in estrogen, the mood-brightening hormone, as a possible cause. Physical discomfort from progesterone, such as water retention or breast tenderness, may also contribute to emotional discomfort. Some </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/46/1/78/5487599?utm_campaign=8-the-inner-autumn&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">research suggests</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0"> that symptoms in women receiving psychiatric care tend to worsen during the luteal phase.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But the truth is: it’s deeply individual. When I ask my friends about their experiences, the answers vary wildly: anger, insecurity, but also calmness, slowness, introversion, or feeling horny. Also: not every cycle feels the same. Sometimes, nothing much happens at all.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">So how did our collective image of PMS become reduced almost entirely to mood swings and irritability?</span></p>

</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In 1981, 37-year-old Christine English crushed her lover against a utility pole with her car. That same year, barmaid Sandie Craddock stabbed a colleague through the heart. Both women were able to </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-5275-4_7?utm_campaign=8-the-inner-autumn&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">avoid criminal punishment</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0"> by blaming PMS. For the record: they were also the only ones ever.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Before the 1980s, PMS was largely considered a private medical matter, barely discussed in public. Even medical journals </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/800607?utm_campaign=8-the-inner-autumn&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">paid little attention</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0">. But after these trials, PMS began appearing in popular literature as a social problem. Of course, this didn’t happen in a vacuum. The 1980s saw a growing number of women entering the workforce, sparking public debates about gender roles and whether biological differences affect women’s ability to perform certain jobs. That conversation continues, in various forms, to this day.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I have also experienced PMS being used against me. Any sign of irritability dismissed with “Oh, you’re just PMSing.” And I’ve also used it as a shield myself, a way of saying, </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><em>let me be, I’m PMSing.</em></span><span class="hxnnnr0"> But over time, I’ve realized just how trapped in the societal perception I was. Our shared narratives strongly shape the reality we live in. The images and stories we create about ourselves and others often form a self-reinforcing loop.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">This idea was captured by many. For example Charles Cooley’s </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><em>looking-glass self</em></span><span class="hxnnnr0"> (1902) suggests that we develop our sense of self based on how we think others see us. Bandura’s </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><em>reciprocal determinism</em></span><span class="hxnnnr0"> (1986) describes a three-way dance between ourselves, our environment, and our behavior, each influencing and reinforcing the others.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In other words: if everyone expects me to be a bitch at a certain time of the month, I might as well be a bitch. But keeping each other stuck in that expectation is not only unnecessary, it's harmful.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">This isn’t to say the intense feelings aren’t real, because they are. But it’s not enough to shove them into a PMS-labeled box and shut it tight. These feelings exist for a reason: they are part of a rhythm, a larger cycle. In order to have a good winter and a joyful spring, I need to respect the autumn.</span></p>

<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Cold nights and rainy weather pull us back inside, to the warmth of our homes. Similarly, in some cultures, women would spend their bleeding time in secluded spaces called menstrual huts or moon lodges. In some places, this was because women were considered impure. Despite government bans, it still occurs in </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46823289?utm_campaign=8-the-inner-autumn&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">for example Nepal</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0">.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But in other cultures, women seclude themselves voluntarily, using the time to reconnect with themselves, to rest and renew their energy. For example, the Ojibwe people, one of the largest Native American tribal populations, regard menstruation as </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2019/02/20/monthly-moons-menstruation-rituals-indigenous-women/?utm_campaign=8-the-inner-autumn&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">a time of cleansing and renewal</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0">, a chance to release accumulated stress and experiences.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I recognize this myself. The premenstrual phase, as I now experience it, is a natural preparation for some kind of release. I sift through what no longer serves me and try to let it go. This process is, of course, uncomfortable and sometimes painful: big feelings take over, and I become sensitive to anything external.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But to understand what truly needs to be released, I have to allow these feelings in and give them space. The inner autumn calls me not only to slow down, but also to listen, to reflect, and to express.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I've found that sharing the discomfort is often the best way to process it. It helps to have another person present to witness, acknowledge and respond. It also creates an opportunity to receive love.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">This can happen in many settings. I've had very positive experiences in women’s circles, where emotions are addressed communally. Our individualistic society puts enormous pressure on us to deal with our shit ourselves. Why though? A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The biggest gains, of course, come from those I'm around most, as they will likely be there when my emotions start spinning out of control. My partner and I therefore have a deal: I tell him everything. It sounds simple, but try it out. The practice is not always easy.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Very often, I have no idea what is happening. I first need to access it somehow. That usually starts with expressing whatever I can and moving on from there. Journaling is another useful tool: just writing without thinking about it too much. Once I begin to understand what’s going on, opening up about it becomes the next big step. It means sharing my innermost fears and demons which feels incredibly vulnerable.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">For him, it means not only listening but also receiving whatever comes up. This can be crying, blaming or even screaming, with compassion and hugs. It’s important to understand that the emotions surfacing aren’t necessarily caused by what’s happening in that exact moment. They might be echoes from childhood, recently triggered fears, or unresolved pain. And I don’t truly know what they are until I express them, bring them into the light, and examine them piece by piece, sometimes over several days.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">My friend described it beautifully: "It’s a time when my intuition speaks loudly". Since I began sharing these emotions regularly and without shame, I’ve learned to hear and release them better. Now, when I enter my premenstrual phase, I don’t fear the tension. I feel gratitude for the insights it brings and the opportunity to reflect.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Sometimes my partner complains that I don’t make any sense. That’s fair and it's not a bug. Emotions are not rational. They are meant to be felt and expressed.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">So next time you are pre-menstrual and you feel the need to get something out, find a friend, prepare your partner, and lay it all out. Cry, scream, share, feel. When the storm passes, laugh. And then let it go.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">And if you are around someone in their inner autumn, be receptive. Be present, be supportive, and don’t take it personally. You might help them enter their spring feeling a little lighter.</span></p>

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But passion has a shadow side: obsession. I used to eat until I couldn’t sneeze (this is true), because even taking a deep breath would hurt my belly. I turned to food for comfort, for emotional support, or simply out of boredom.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">One day, I stepped on the scale and saw the number 90 staring back at me. That moment of shock sent me on a long journey to change my relationship with food.</span></p>

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">That was ten years and 25 kilos ago.

<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">During my final years of high school, I worked part-time at McDonald’s and honestly, I had a fantastic time. The colleagues were great, and for post-communist Slovakia, the pay was decent.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">It also gave me a peak behind the curtain of the fast food industry.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">McDonald’s likes to promote the idea that its food can be part of a healthy, balanced diet. But in reality, it doesn’t meet any of the criteria: meals that are limited in calories, made with healthy fats and whole grains, low in salt and sugar, rich in essential nutrients and fiber, and built around fresh, unprocessed ingredients.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In truth, there was hardly anything fresh in the entire kitchen except the tomato and cucumber slices we had to grab from the local supermarket. And it gets worse.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Burger patties arrived in giant plastic bags from who-knows-where. Frozen gray discs that only got their brown color after a couple of minutes on the grill. In fact, nearly everything was frozen and varying shades of gray before it was deep fried.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But the most disturbing I found the eggs: they came in already peeled, in big plastic buckets filled with greenish water. To this day, I have no idea what it was. We put them on the Caesar salads.

</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I stopped eating the food within a couple of months of working there.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Real food is nothing like what I saw in the kitchen of McDonalds. For example, all you need to make a basic tortilla is wheat flour, salt, water, and oil.</span></p>

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">You’ve probably heard the term "ultra-processed food" or UPF. It’s not just a fast-food chain problem. Our supermarkets too are full of them.</span></p>

                <div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I have a recurrent dream. It's been going on for years. The circumstances are always different, but the theme is constant: I am packing. Packing, but I can't finish in time. Packing, but I don't have enough bags. Packing and suddenly discovering more things that need to be packed. You get the idea.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The significance of this dream has eluded me for years. But I think it’s time to get to the core of it. So I’ve decided to unpack. Unboxing party! And you’re invited.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="safety" class="hynlcx0">
<h2 class="hynlcx1 hynlcx3"><span class="hxnnnr0">Safety</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Bags. We all have them. Big bags, small bags, fabric bags, backpacks, shoulder bags, hand bags, bum bags, shopping totes, purses, suitcases, briefcases, luggage. Even pockets and car trunks too.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">At their core, bags are containers. Tools that help us carry what we need. But they are more than that. They are a fashion statement, reflection of our identity. Do you carry a sporty backpack with hip straps? A sleek designer purse? A minimalist bum bag?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">A former colleague of mine carried both a backpack and a purse. When I asked her why, she said, “The backpack is for the laptop. But that’s not me. The purse, that’s me.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Curious, I asked my friends on Instagram what they carry around: keys, phone, lose cash, credit card, wallet, raincoat, lip balm, moisturizer, eye drops, water bottle, mirror, lip stick, ear plugs, bottle opener, mints, allergy pills, pocket knife, inhaler, ear phones, sunglasses, sewing kit, pain killers, hand fan in the summer. Condoms ("cos you never know"). Some carried just three items. Others fifteen.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In fact, researchers studying people with dementia in care homes found that handbags often became "something to continually clutch or hold" as their sense of orientation slipped away. A kind of anchor. Another researcher, who rummaged through dozens of women’s handbags, noted the mix of practical and emotional objects like photographs or talismans. Each, he concluded, tied to a specific anxiety or fear.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I relate. My own anxiety often unpacks itself when I pack for travel. Overthinking what I might need, packing too much. As a result I create an absurdly heavy bag that I lug around the entire trip. It’s as if I believe that if I just pack perfectly, everything will be okay.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But I can’t pack for everything, can I?</span></p>

<div id="perfectionism" class="hynlcx0">
<h2 class="hynlcx1 hynlcx3"><span class="hxnnnr0">Perfectionism</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Last week I hiked up a mountain to sleep in a hut. After climbing all day, I arrived, removed my boots, and as my feet touched the stone cold floor I realized: my slippers were still at home, about 1,500 meters below.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Cue the voice in my head.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Whenever I used to mess something up this angry voice would kick in. How stupid can you be? I call this voice the Asshole. It took me a while, but now I see that the Asshole is a perfectionist.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I would never have described myself as one. I thought perfectionism only meant turning in pristine projects or obsessively scoring top marks on every test. That didn’t feel like me.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But perfectionism, I’ve learned, </span><span class="hxnnnr0"><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-reality-of-gen-z/202109/10-signs-of-a-problem-with-perfectionism?utm_campaign=6-i-dream-of-packing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_3k8pkd0">is much broader</a></span><span class="hxnnnr0">. It’s the internal critic. It’s comparing myself to others: prettier, smarter, more successful. It’s feeling like I always need to be prepared for anything, or I’ve failed to make my world safe.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But do I really want to live like that? Isn’t it actually more fun to leave space for the unexpected?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">As my feet grew colder high up on the mountain, I remembered a table in front of the hut selling Nepalese scarves, gloves and yes, you guessed it: thick woolen socks. I bought a pair. They’ve become the warmest socks I own.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">It was kind of perfect, wasn't it?</span></p>

<div id="emotional-baggage" class="hynlcx0">
<h2 class="hynlcx1 hynlcx3"><span class="hxnnnr0">Emotional baggage</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Because it’s 2025 and this is what we do now, I asked a chatbot what my packing dream means. And boy, it did deliver.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="nrf06a0">
<pre class="nrf06a1"><code>“In dreams, luggage, bags, and boxes are classic symbols for a person’s 'mental baggage'—the emotional burdens, unresolved issues, and past experiences that have shaped and weighed on them.”</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Hmm, go on...</span></p>
</div>
<div class="nrf06a0">
<pre class="nrf06a1"><code>“The recurring nature of the dream suggests a resistance to letting go of that baggage.”</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Ouch.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="nrf06a0">
<pre class="nrf06a1"><code>“The dream is a stressful reminder that it’s impossible to carry every past experience, trauma, and former version of oneself into the future. The psyche is indicating that, to move forward, a release is necessary.”</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Bags are also a metaphor. Not just physical containers, but mental ones too. Mental baggage can weigh us down in the same way as a heavy backpack. Carrying around trauma, fear, or shame will in turn shape the way I act in the world. And not for the better.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">But letting go isn’t simple. It's not like we can just take it out with the garbage and leave. Emotional baggage may be heavy, but it’s familiar. It also creates the illusion of predictability and safety.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="letting-go" class="hynlcx0">
<h2 class="hynlcx1 hynlcx3"><span class="hxnnnr0">Letting go</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">When I was 25, Miško died. He was my partner, my soulmate, my best friend. We broke up and he took his own life. It is the most painful thing that has ever happened to me and naturally, it created a lot of baggage. Sorrow. Fear of abandonment. And probably other things I still can not name.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I mourned him for years. I organized a memorial for his death anniversary every year. And then, after 11 years, I stopped.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I realized I had been clinging to grief because I thought I owed it to his memory to be sad forever. That it would somehow erase his existence if I stopped. Turns out none of that is true. My baggage was shaping my world and I let it.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Letting go wasn't instant. It took years. But little by little, with conscious attention, it is possible.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I have thought about this specific line from the chatbot's text: "To move forward, a release is necessary". And a little poem came to me:</span></p>
</div>
<div class="_1gqvddm0">
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0"><strong>I need this</strong></span><br><br><em><span class="hxnnnr0">But is it still shiny?</span></em><br><em><span class="hxnnnr0">Still light?</span></em><br><em><span class="hxnnnr0">Or are the colors fading?</span></em><br><em><span class="hxnnnr0">Is the flame dwindling down?</span></em><br><em><span class="hxnnnr0">Maybe it is time.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Years ago, after another long-term relationship ended, I had a different dream. I lost my backpack in the dream and then thought: That’s fine. Everything I need will find me.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">I would like to work towards that trust.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">So I stopped seeing my packing dreams as something to fix and started seeing them as invitations to loosen my grip. So I can travel light.</span></p>

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">The trust that everything I need will find me actually comes quite naturally when I stop interfering. The urge to plan for every possible outcome is still a bit squirrel-like.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">Squirrels are scatter hoarders. They hide thousands of nuts in dozens of places every season. But they also forget where they put most of them. And yet they survive. The forest sustains them even in winter with bark, tree sap, berries, fungi and lichen. Or they might find the stash of another squirrel. Their survival isn’t based on a perfect memory or planning, but on living in relationship with their environment. And the forgotten nuts? They grow into trees.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">In the same way, whatever I let go of, whatever I forget, can become a fertile ground for something new. A new discovery, a needed item turning up. A new connection when seeking support. Finding a water fountain in the city, or warm socks on the mountain. I’m learning I don’t need to be perfectly self-sufficient. There is abundance out there.</span></p>

<div class="j6zgbu0">
<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">And if all fails, there is cash in my wallet (not that poetic but very practical!).</span></p>

<p class="dream-post-content-paragraph j6zgbu1"><span class="hxnnnr0">So when I tune into my body, I sense what truly wants to come with me. I listen for what is essential and what feels right.

                <div>
<p>Somewhere in the early 2010s, I met Melanie in Barcelona. I was a broke freelance journalist traveling for a workshop and needed a place to stay. I found Melanie on CouchSurfing, and she kindly agreed to host me. Back then, mobile data wasn’t really a thing yet, but Wi-Fi was everywhere: open city networks, cafés. Just not in her apartment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Melanie was a young American who had moved to Spain a year earlier. She used to work at Apple, which made her one of the early adopters of the iPhone. She told me how she’d hang out with friends at bars or restaurants, but everyone would just be on their phones. They’d even chat privately about people at the table—as if talking behind their backs, while sitting right next to them. She came to hate that, and eventually banned the internet from her home. The evening I spent with her, she knitted and drew,</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the study, the Chinese users ranked among the most addicted. <a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958823000325?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another small</a> study among 180 Chinese university students found they spent on average 5.5 hours a day on their phones. That is more than one third of their waking hours. To put that into perspective: in 2023, the Chinese government <a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/business/china-smartphone-minor-mode.html?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction#:~:text=The%20proposal%20says%20the%20minor,content%20for%20different%20age%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> to limit children younger than 8 to 40 minutes of smartphone time a day, increasing the time limit to two hours daily when adult. That is also roughly how much time I spend on my smartphone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You know what? Let’s get intimate. Here is my data 🤳</p>
</div>
<div>
<div><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/71db9c77-b2d0-4a68-b3e5-af0b9952235d/socialmediausage.png?t=1748766487" alt="" width="679" height="869" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Back to the Chinese students: as a result of their smartphone use, some reported mild depression, blurring eyesight, sore fingers, distorted sense of time, poor sleep or feelings of anxiety when scrolling. But not everone is bothered by it. One student put it this way: “<i>I know that using a smartphone for 6 hours daily is a bit too much [but] since I am so happy when playing on the device, and making changes will be painful, why do I need to control my usage? If the purpose of life is to pursue happiness, smartphones can indeed fulfill my needs.</i>” And honestly, who’s to say they are wrong?</p>
</div>
<div id="a-very-persuasive-design">
<h2>A very persuasive design</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The main reason your phone brings you that hit of joy in the moment is because it’s intentionally designed to trigger your dopamine reward centers. It’s not that the phone is incredibly useful. It’s just incredibly good at creating compulsive behavior.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is called <i>persuasive design</i>, and it’s what Duolingo uses to keep you coming back to your language lessons. But even well-intentioned features, like Facebook’s "like" button, originally meant to spread positivity, ended up fueling also feelings of comparison or envy. In the battle for our attention, platforms deploy all kinds of design tricks to keep us hooked: endless scrolling, endless recommendations, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is actually also a field of study, called <i>captology.</i> It explores<i> </i>how interactive technologies are built to shape what we believe and how we behave. It observes that we humans respond to computers as though they were well ... humans.</p>

It is their job to persuade you to keep pulling that lever over and over again. Or when a chatbot that says “I’m sorry.”, making it seem like it understands how you feel. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>As an investigative journalist I often ask myself the question who is benefiting (and despite of that yes my life is still fun.) According to several — let’s say “<a class="link" href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20250110?f=5&amp;utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less</a> than <a class="link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/most-popular-apps/?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect</a>” — data sources, rocking the charts of most downloaded apps are <i>Instagram</i>, <i>TikTok</i>, <i>WhatsApp</i>, <i>Facebook</i>, and <i>ChatGPT</i>. In other words, a large chunk of our phone time is spent inside the carefully crafted gardens of <i>Meta</i> and a few others. These apps are packed with persuasive design, and none of them let you opt out of it. I can’t tweak or change how they work. There is no choice. Which makes me believe, that my smartphone isn’t really mine at all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But it could be! We could design apps that put users in control. <a class="link" href="https://www.hertie-school.org/fileadmin/2_Research/2_Research_directory/Research_Centres/Centre_for_Digital_Governance/5_Papers/Student_publications/Student_working_paper_series/2023_Digital_Addiction_by_Design.pdf?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hi-it-s-ada-5-phone-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For example</a> by giving us the option to:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>build in stopping points—so scrolling actually ends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hide like, view, or comment counts when you choose to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set time limits for how long you use certain apps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>customize how an app looks and behaves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fine-tune how content is personalized</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or even just get a gentle reminder to take a break</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>These are not radical ideas. But sadly, I don’t see them being adopted anytime soon. As long as our attention keeps making these companies richer, they’ll keep mining it—relentlessly.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div id="leave-my-attention-alone">
<h2>Leave my attention alone</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Right now, the only real weapon I feel I have is boycott. That’s why I’ve chosen to completely disconnect from my smartphone between 8PM and 10AM. I put it in the designated wooden box, close the lid shut and just like that ✨ it stops existing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Then I sit on the sofa with a cup of tea and feel a small wave of panic. What now?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So I sit a little longer. And slowly, ideas start to arrive. I get up and browse the bookcase. I sit at the piano. I take out my watercolors and play kindergarten for a bit. I practice handstands. And by the time I go to sleep, I feel so much better knowing I didn’t spend my last hours of the day numbing my brain with dopamine triggers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Later this year, I plan to take things even further—go for a long hike in the mountains, pack a tent and some food, and spend at least a week off the grid, surrounded by nothing but nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I can’t wait.</p>

                <div>
<p>Thinking about the recent 💥 in AI technologies fascinates me from many perspectives. One of them is the question of <strong>craftsmanship</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the recent past, we saw that new strategies and technologies in the production of goods such as food, clothes or furniture resulted in a situation where quantity wins over quality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Just notice when walking through the aisles of a fast fashion chain or meandering in the wonderfully homey IKEA journey. All these wonderful things, just for me! <strong>Gosh</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The current inhabitants of the middle class around the world eat food that was grown fast and loaded with fillers, wear clothes that will fall apart within the year, and sit on sofas that will need to be replaced within five.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I can feel the pain of the farmers, carpenters and tailors whose crafts were cheapened. Now, it’s my turn: <strong>AI comes for the writers, the coders, the thinkers</strong>. Designers, photographers, illustrators, film makers, copywriters, journalists, programmers, customer service representatives, you name it. Nobody is safe.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a certain Michael F. Buckley, a designer, writes in his fantastic essay <a class="link" href="https://uxdesign.cc/quality-wont-save-designers-from-ai-ba687e91167f?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=is-craftsmanship-overrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quality won’t save designers from AI</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><i>History suggests that speed and affordability often outweigh craftsmanship when consumer habits are reshaped.</i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This quote has been haunting me ever since.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My own craft as a data journalist and educator is rich: I code, I do research, I write, I teach. I have been using LLMs to write texts, conduct online research, create images and code for me (and with me) over the past couple of months. On a regular basis I use ChatGPT, Visual Electric, DeepSeek and Claude.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When coding, I’ve tried it all: asking the robot to write boring scrapers for me in a language I understand well (Python) or to code a little <a class="link" href="https://homolova.sk/chartgarden/?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=is-craftsmanship-overrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app that exports vector charts</a> in a language I barely get (JavaScript).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>They call it <strong>vibe coding</strong>. You instruct the LLM in plain speech and the AI transforms that thinking into executable code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And since almost anybody writing code today has been seduced with the allure of vibe coding, sometimes I ask myself: <i>Has the craft I have been honing for years lost it’s value overnight?</i> Or will it in a year?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It seems not to be the case (yet). There is much more to data journalism than plain coding. But I also feel I have to learn to work with the robots in order to stay relevant and competitive in my field.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To grow my craft with the new tools, not in spite of them. Because they can also be great interns, sparring partners and even teachers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But I also need to be careful. When I have the robot write code for me, I feel myself succumbing to the vibe. The comfort is taking over, and I stop engaging with the content and I let it do its thing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But when I stop engaging with the content, I stop understanding and learning new things. <strong>And there is no craft in blindly following your tools.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This applies to writing, researching, teaching and even baking or fixing my German grammar mistakes. Use the robot to do things, but ask it why it did what it did and try to learn from it. To make the craft shine brighter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Because if we only let them do their thing, we might drown<i>—</i>under bad code, under meaningless text, just as we drown in the mountains of fast-produced clothes <a class="link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/fashion-disposal-environment/?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=is-craftsmanship-overrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piling up in the Chilean desert</a> or the <a class="link" href="https://smartblogideas.com/giant-piles-of-britains-unwanted-clothes-wash-up-on-ghanas-beaches/?utm_source=hi-im-ada.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=is-craftsmanship-overrated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beaches of Ghana</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So is craftsmanship overrated? No. I believe it’s actually one of the more beautiful things we have available to us as humans. If anything, we should cherish it more. And we can do so with the robots too, if we like.</p>

                <p>At the end of 2024, I asked some friends and colleagues a question: "Which topic do you think is the most important to write about next year?" I loved these conversations because they took me to unexpected places. So, I posed the same question to people on the internet and received <strong>31 responses</strong>, which I am now sharing with you. <a href="https://homolova.sk/blog/topics-that-matter-most-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In my previous post</a>, I discussed the first seven answers that addressed the new <strong>world order</strong>. Today, I will dive deeper into two other categories: <strong>climate &amp; energy </strong>and <strong>conflict</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Climate</strong> and <strong>conflict</strong> are closely intertwined, as both contribute to vulnerabilities in our societies. As a warm-up for what is coming below, you might want to explore Climate-Conflict-Vulnerability Index and their <a href="httpshttps://climate-conflict.org/www/data-pages/hazards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive world map</a>, which is both beautiful and disturbing to look at.</p>

Beneath each response, I offer my reflections, additional resources, and datasets, hopefully inspiring you to explore further.</p>
<p>I must confess, this post isn't exactly cheerful, but if you hang in there, you'll discover the curious connection between duck bellies and solar power production. </p>
<p>Let's get to it.</p>

<h2>Conflict</h2>
<p>To be honest, this category made me feel very uneasy—so uneasy that I didn't want to comment on any of the answers at all. However, as I witness the world becoming a stranger place every day, I'm realizing how important it is that we face these conflicts and consider carefully how we want them to be resolved.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">8. Conflicts around the globe e.g. Ukraine, Gaza, because humanity will erase itself in WW3</p>
<p>This is likely very true. There are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons" target="_blank">12,000 nuclear warheads</a> in the world. Half of them are in the hands of an authoritarian despot, and the other half... well, never mind.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">9. Gaza, because it s the moral defeat and the win of money, capitalism and colonialism.</p>
<p>Gaza is a place that, years from now, we will look back on with the same horror as we do Auschwitz today. The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) has identified <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/israel-palestine-lebanon/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/israel-palestine-lebanon/" target="_blank">Palestine of 2024</a> as the world's most dangerous and violent place. Fortunately, President Trump's administration plans to step in, promising to "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make Gaza Beautiful Again</a>".</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">10. Why are violent cultures are more likely to succeed? Violence throughout history, but also the middle east, and in religion has always led to people becoming apathetic and retreating. See China, see Russia, see Gaza, Afghanistan or Lebanon. In what non-violent ways, can a people or culture win against a violent Regime? Is it possible? For example Falun Gong. Or Kurds. Is it OK to lose ones cultures and identity, if it leads to peace?</p>
<p class="el-p">Non-violent actions can indeed topple governments. One of the most significant examples in relatively recent history is the series of mostly peaceful protests that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. More recently, we have witnessed the Arab Spring. So, is it possible? Yes. But how?</p>
<p class="el-p">To refine your nonviolent strategies, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/guide-effective-nonviolent-struggle-2/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/guide-effective-nonviolent-struggle-2/" target="_blank">read the free guidebook</a> published by The International Center for Nonviolent Conflict. The authors delve into strategies, marketing, security, resources, and more. I especially liked the part focusing on pillars of support: civilians, businesses, police, military and other structures that keep the power in place.</p>
<p class="el-p msg msg--highlight ">11. The military upscaling world-wide, especially European countries USA will probably diminish in their role as a deterrent for aggressors on European soil, waking up the EU to take action to be able to fend for themselves in case it's necessary. This may be a good thing, since it would mean less dependency on the US for our safety. But historically, whenever all of Europe decided the best course of action is to increase their military spending, world wars happened. It's a bad sign, or omen, if you will. And something that we should all be following closely the coming year.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">12. State of the military industrial production in the NATO countries. Russia has switched its industrial output to full military economy. When there is a peace in Ukraine it will take 1 year for Putin to re arm to the state before the war.</p>
<p class="el-p">Let's combine insights from two datasets to gain some fresh perspective. First, according to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex" target="_blank">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>, these are the countries that spent the most on the military in 2023. Second: China, India, and Turkey have emerged as Russia's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/russian-foreign-trade-tracker" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/russian-foreign-trade-tracker" target="_blank">most prominent trade partners</a> post-invasion.</p>

<div class="el-p">What will happen in the future is uncertain. For the newsletter of the Follow The Money Brussels desk, I've visualized the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-vape-lobbying-brussels-follow-the-money-eu-19uwe/?trackingId=1h8LF9LgQJ2WzuguBHCk0g%3D%3D" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-vape-lobbying-brussels-follow-the-money-eu-19uwe/?trackingId=1h8LF9LgQJ2WzuguBHCk0g%3D%3D" target="_blank">projected EU budget for the military</a>. By 2027, it's expected to be nearly twice as large as it was in 2021.</div>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">13. The war to end all wars. On principle, we, humanity, want to end all wars but we’ve seen a huge surge in disgustingly violent, ruthless and needless wars. I do hope that a war to end all wars will not be necessary but looks like Others will make that decision and dump it on us to deal with. It might not suffice, though, because the military complex will find more wars to be had. They gotta put food on the table! :) Are we ever getting off of this bloody merry-go-round?</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/year/2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yearly wrap-up</a>, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program concluded that 2023 marked the highest number of active state-based armed conflicts "ever recorded by the UCDP, totaling 59." It seems the time to invest is indeed ripe.  <br>  <br>In October 2024, Citigroup, one of the big four US banks, published <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/money-and-might-financing-the-future-of-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> outlining possible future scenarios and investment opportunities in the defense sector. I found point 3 here especially cynical.</p>

<p>Ok now take a deep breath. Ready for the second tranche of man-made catastrophes? Here we go.</p>
<h2>Climate &amp; Energy</h2>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">14. Climate, because civilizational collapse is a thing</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">15. I'm an economics journalist – but climate is going to touch everything. The sooner we make the connections the better.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">16. Climate crisis. Why is quite clear: without a livable planet no life.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Half of the answers in this category were very short, yet the topic is incredibly broad.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">17. Climate change is the most pressing issue we're facing right now. And of course this ties in with many other issues: inequality (between and within countries), politics (populism, lack of faith in politicians, growing apathy from voters when talking about politics and policy-making?), (social) media (where do people get their information? how can journalists/writers/... make people care? and how do we avoid depressing people to the point of apathy?)</p>
<p class="el-p">I liked this answer because it touches upon a topic that I haven't seen addressed often: the mental health aspects of climate change. On one hand we are dealing with mental health issues associated with extreme weather events: PTSD, trauma.</p>
<p class="el-p">We also deal with something called <strong>solastalgia</strong>: the distress that comes from environmental changes around our home environment, combined with a sense of powerlessness over these changes. The word comes from the Latin <em>sōlācium</em> (solace or comfort), <em>solus</em> (desolation), and the Greek <em>algia</em> (pain, suffering, grief). It reminds me of the disappearance of snow in winter, but for others, it will be more severe.</p>

<p class="el-p msg msg--highlight ">18. The energy transition. The news in 2024 has largely, and understandably, been captured by politics, and it has been ages that climate change has been front and center. I am afraid, that is partly because climate change lives in people's minds as yet another disaster we don't want to think about, which is why I think that stories about the energy transition can be a force for good. It's happening, amazing strides are being made, and it builds a future that we want to live in if we pull it off.</p>

Initially, the bot said, "The energy transition is not on track, and the situation is likely to worsen without significant changes." This made me properly sad, so I asked if they could find me some hopeful news. Luckily, they could. "The message is clear: we are making substantial progress in the global energy transition, and there's genuine hope for a sustainable, clean energy future." That made me feel better.

(New) Energy Production - Battle between nuclear and renewables. Big tech is investing in nuclear power plants, so won't be long before investors also realize electricity production is a priority.

Electricity can be the more efficient way to power things (e.g. induction stove uses less raw energy than a gas stove). So there has been a push to electrify much of society in the last decade or so (think electric cars. On top of this, and this is probably the bigger thing, is the use and production of AI models requires a lot of power, and big tech are building record amounts of data centres. All of this means that we need much more electricity.<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">While there is a lot of traditional renewables (wind, hydro, solar) being added to grids around the world, the intermittency can be annoying since it requires either battery storage, dynamic pricing (so factories will operate at night when its cheaper), or large inter-connectivity (e.g. Spain sells its solar to Netherlands) to flatten out the duck curve (google it).<br><br></span><span style="background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">In response to this, big tech in the US have started taking matters into their own hands and are producing the electricity themselves for the big data centres, since they don't want to wait and let the AI trend miss them.

I think because the power needed for that is becoming a bottleneck, we will see capital flow into electricity production in the coming years. I think it will be interesting how this capital is spent, since gas and nuclear can give a solid predictable power output, these are desired by data centres, however the public leans towards renewables (usually). I think there will be a bit of a battle between the nuclear camp and the renewable camp over this, with possible more money going towards nuclear in many places. It may also be the case that big tech could say: '"We will only come to places where there are good nuclear reactors with cheap power, since we prefer predictability and profits".

<p>See the orange line? While the sun is shining, there's a lot of energy coming in, and the need for other energy sources decreases. That's the belly of the duck. And that's good—free energy! But it's also problematic because the grid needs electricity at all times. So, once the sun sets and energy demand rises sharply, other sources need to be up and running again. Sudden changes like that can stress the grid. Moreover, you can't just turn off a nuclear plant in the morning and switch it back on in the evening.  <br>  <br>This rabbit hole is deep, and I won't dive into it for now.

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/zufanka_Broligarchy_how_tech_and_similar_bros_are_broing_away_4a39518c-15c9-4399-949a-c96b6c77cc3b_1.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Two men dressed in suits and sunglasses, sitting back-to-back on an ornate bench, each engrossed in using a tablet." /></p>
                <p>At the end of 2024, I asked a some friends and colleagues a question: "Which topic do you think is the most important to write about next year?" and got some very diverse answers. A friend who is a designer and visual artist suggested to make people aware that no piece of information is neutral. A colleague reflected on the power of Musk and his army of satellites. And another friend simply said: "Nothing. I can't do anything with the news." </p>
<p>The conversations were so interensting that I decided to scale it up. At the end of November I tossed a survey into my network and let it cook there for a couple of weeks. This resulted in a fresh batch of <strong>31 answers </strong>to ponder.</p>
<p>Some topics made an expected appearance. Climate, for instance, was mentioned 11 times accross all the answers. However many responses surprised me. And so I have found myself diving into democracy metrics, world population predictions, duck curves and dark data.</p>
<p>While putting all the answers together to share with you, it started turning into a bit of a mammoth piece. So, I decided to split it into multiple parts. In the upcoming weeks I will write multiple posts. In each of them I will unpack several of the responses, divided into categories (more on those below).</p>
<p>In this first part, I will discuss the (simple) analysis I used to organize the responses and share the first, albeit unsurprising, category: <strong>world order</strong>.</p>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>While the survey was open, I considered using some of the modern and hyped ways to analyse and visualise the data. Should I use an LLM? While browsing the Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a>, I realized that my data were actually little stories, rather than numbers. And that to make sense of these stories, it was better to approach them with attention and understanding. So, I closed the browser tab full of models and opened the spreadsheet with the responses. Then I spent a few hours — and then a few more — studying them.</p>
<p>Even if not using any fancy statstics, I wanted to introduce some structure. My beautiful organic brain proved to be the perfect tool for this. First I wrote down a few keywords for each response. Then, I looked for overlaps and recurring themes within these keywords and distilled them into broader categories. In practice, I added two columns next to the responses, which looked something like this:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;"><strong>keywords</strong></td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;"><strong>category</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">war, military upscaling, changing role of the USA, national security, war</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">conflict</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">climate, technology impacts, energy requirements</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">climate &amp; energy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 67.4558%;">positive news, rethinking journalism, positive trends, positive outlook, diversity of opinions</td>
<td style="width: 32.5157%;">journalism</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The categories that came up in the end were 🥁: <strong>climate &amp; energy, </strong><strong>world order, conflict, information, oneness, demographics, housing, human rights, journalism, </strong>and<strong> trust. </strong>Naturally, there is some overlap between them, but I did my best to extract the most prominent theme from each response to highlight larger trends.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/categories.png" alt="" width="632" height="749" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/categories-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p>Below you will find the responses from the first prominent category: <strong>world order</strong>.<strong> </strong>The answers are provided in full, lightly edited, and include some of my own reflections, data and other resources. Enjoy!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/bro1-2.png" alt="" width="137" height="112" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/bro1-2-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<h2>World order</h2>
<p>The responses in this category focus on the shifting political climate. They highlight concerns about the rise of populist leaders, far-right sentiments, and the changing role of the U.S. They question the direction modern democracies are heading.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">2. The democracy is under pressure in Europe, in some countries more than others. In the Netherlands, people generally believe everything is still OK,  but also here the democracy gets weaker and weaker. It would be good to get some relevant data, do some comparisons, pick some interesting examples and raise some awareness on this. 1. Europe: European Union, how Europe is becoming more and more right-wing</span></p>
<p>This observation is simple and straightforward and has some interesting implications. For example, after the Austrian government recently failed to form a coalition, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> noted a "<em>growing difficulty of forming stable governments in European countries [...] where the far right is on the rise but many parties are loath to partner with them</em>.<em>"</em></p>
<p>I wanted to verify this claim, but the most recent data analysis I found was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053168015622796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 2015.</a> In the process, I came across wondeful data from <a href="https://www.parlgov.org/data-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParlGov</a>, though they unfortunately don't seem to offer an easy way to calculate how long coalition formations take.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">2. The democracy is under pressure in Europe, in some countries more than others. In the Netherlands, people generally believe everything is still OK,  but also here the democracy gets weaker and weaker. It would be good to get some relevant data, do some comparisons, pick some interesting examples and raise some awareness on this. </span></p>
<p>Curious about how democracy is measured, I fired up <a href="/blog/making-internet-search-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecosia search</a> and found an impressive overview of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement"></a><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracies-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight leading indexes to measure democracy</a> by Our World in Data. Spending some time exploring their <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Varieties+of+Democracy&amp;Metric=Electoral+democracy&amp;Sub-metric=Main+index&amp;country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive visualisations</a> I began to see that there just might be something to it. See below the Varieties of democracy index for the Netherlands. Similarly, their <a href="https://v-dem.net/documents/43/v-dem_dr2024_lowres.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> is not very uplifting: "<em>Almost all components of democracy are getting worse in more countries than they are getting  better, compared to ten years ago."</em></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/vdemnetherlands.png" alt="V-Dem index in the Netherlands going down" width="839" height="605" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/10/responsive/vdemnetherlands-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">3. Totalitarianism in Europe. Totalitarian trends (or fear of totalitarian trends, fear of public unrest, active instrumentalisation of groups in difficult political challenges) overshadow meaningful political discussions on all important topics such as the climate crisis, inequality and polarisation in societies, environmental issues such as pollution with chemicals, plastics and the resulting health crisis... The general wish to maintain a "business as usual" approach in spite of all the above concerns may be among the keys to start covering this challenge. </span></p>
<p>This response, as I interpret it, suggests focusing on totalitarian trends in Europe to clear the way for discussions about truly pressing issues.</p>
<p>Three other responses focused on the situation in the US, with Trump and Musk at the wheel.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">4. The change in geopolitics brought on by the US elections. With Trump (and Musk) getting into office, we will see a shift of power away from the state to private individuals. In military conflicts, this has already been foreshadowed by the Starlink story in Ukraine and Musk’s ties to the global far-right. Moreover, capital will become increasingly privatized as the new government aims to unleash anonymous cryptocapitalism. Gradually, governments’ former monetary powers will slip from democratic control.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">5. Trump and how it influences our safety in Europe or the Pacific even (Taiwan)=</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">6. Broligarchy: how tech and similar bros are broing away rights and broifying politics. The bro approach to business and politics shapes social media algorithms, elections, lobbying and political priorities</span></p>
<p>('Broing away' is now my new favorite verb!) On a serious note, what fascinates me most about the U.S. situation is how the ultra-rich are taking over politics. Although this is nothing new.</p>
<p>Chrystia Freeland (then a journalist, now Canada’s former finance minister) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plutocrats-Rise-Global-Super-Rich-Everyone/dp/1594204098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a book</a> about rising plutocracy already in 2012<em>:</em> "<em>As the people at the very top become ever richer, they have an ever greater ability to tilt the rules of the game in their favor. That power can be hard to resist."</em> And the trend is not going away either. According to data from Altrata, the population of billionaires in the US <a href="https://info.altrata.com/l/311771/2024-11-17/21wbj4/311771/1731871576Li7G5zyb/Altrata_Billionaire_Census_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up by nearly 10%</a> (1,111 people) in 2023. Both US and Europe hold 1/3 of worlds billionaires.</p>
<p>Recently I came across a fascinating essay in the MacGuffin magazine. Here, the author reflects on the world perception of the ultra-rich: "<em>My main observation is that for individuals born into extreme wealth, it is almost impossible to grasp anything about material or social reality."</em> He continues: <em>"To inherit a condition of unjustifiable wealth means to never experience cause and effect. All external pressures are alleviated by capital: there are no consequences to missing a deadline, to not finishing a project, to dropping out or giving up. It is terrifically difficult to fail, in any normal sense."</em> Trump and Musk are both second generation ultra-rich. I recommend to <a href="https://www.macguffinmagazine.com/stories/macguffin-plutocrat-archipelagos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the whole essay</a>. It's terrifying. Let's just hope it's not such<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/01/02/tech-is-coming-to-washington-prepare-for-a-clash-of-cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a match made in heaven</a>.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">7. Ukraine and and derivative stories such as societal security and preparedness in a new world order, where the climate is also 'attacking' us harder and harder. It is fundamentally about our existence and our way of organizing the world: democracy, equality, diversity - the right to be an independent human being. There is a reason why people fleeing to northern Europe! The refugee flows are not going away from Europe and certainly not away from the northwestern corner. So we do something right here, something other people on this planet wants too. No one flees to the autocracies!</span></p>
<p>The final answer in this category suggests something intriguing: <em>we are doing something right here</em>. </p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">What exactly is it, and how can we preserve it amidst a shifting world order?</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet search sucks. It's not just my personal opinion.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/googleisgettingworse.png" alt="screenshots of articles about google getting worse" width="1200" height="1200" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-xs.png 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-sm.png 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-md.png 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/googleisgettingworse-lg.png 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don't trust the media, maybe you do trust the Germans: their university researchers came to the same sad conclusion </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“that higher-ranked pages are on average more optimized, more monetized [...] and they show signs of lower text quality”, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reads their recent</span><a href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you recognize this from recipe websites. While the recipe is the part you are really interested in, at some point in history recipe pages started to bloat. Now you need to plow through a pile of text and pictures before you can even take a look at  the recipe itself. This additional clutter helps individual recipe pages rank better in search results: "When I’m writing, I try to tell a story that has a hook as well as please[s] the Google algorithm,", </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-are-there-long-stories-on-food-blogs?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says this food blogger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But what Google wants to show is not necessarily what everybody wants to read. Such ‘optimisation’ then gives birth to projects like </span><a href="https://www.justtherecipe.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">justtherecipe.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - a website and app that only extracts the recipe from any given website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pessimists say that the internet is only going to </span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get more cluttered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the dawn of generative AI, we will swim in more and more low quality content. The internet</span><a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will never be the same</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it was when populated just by us  - the humans. And as much as I love robots, they also produce text that can contradict itself in consecutive sentences;  in a much worse case it can make you</span><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/03/ai-written-mushroom-hunting-guides-sold-on-amazon-potentially-deadly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poison yourself with mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bots are also capable of making us forget what a baby peacock looks like.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/notalwaysbabypeacock.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="996" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-xs.jpg 300w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-sm.jpg 480w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-md.jpg 768w ,https://homolova.sk/media/posts/8/responsive/notalwaysbabypeacock-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we search for high quality content in waters made murky by SEO optimization and generative AI? For me a  search engine is like a map, and I have to keep reminding myself that like a map it only ever shows part of the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has been steadily </span><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-200901-202409"><span style="font-weight: 400;">holding about 90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the search engine market for at least the last 15 years. But the good news is you don’t have to keep on only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Googling.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The key to any healthy diet is variety. So take my hand into the (expanding) possibilities of searching the web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day I use a couple of different search engines. All of them are designed with a different approach to indexing the web.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword search</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is my default search engine. I use it when I know what I am searching for: company names, people, wikipedia articles, documentation. Under the hood it uses two of the big boys : </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Bing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The search is therefore still not better than Google, but their business is. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the largest not-for-profit search engine that puts 100% of their revenues into</span><a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">planting trees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as search, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also offers a free</span><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/chat"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI chat feature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based on GPT-3. This one I use for translations and when I need definitions of some terms or phenomena. I also use it for basic recipes, and tweaks for recipes (especially for baking - which I still find mesmerizing).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not completely out of my system, but I currently use it only when I can not find things via Ecosia. Google is amazingly good at finding out where to buy things online, so I do my infrequent online shopping ventures on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is what I like to see as a serendipity search engine: you never know what you will get. The index is built by Swedish developer, Viktor Löfgren, mostly on grant money (he also has a</span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/marginalia_nu"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">patreon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It  focuses on “small obscure websites and non-commercial content”, as the author puts it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I love about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that when I searched for a recipe for a crumble, instead of one of the sterile over-optimized recipe pages, I discovered the Kitchen Projects substack, where somebody called Nicola Lamb documents their</span><a href="https://kitchenprojects.substack.com/p/plum-crumble-pie"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiments in crumble baking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next to the recipe, she also shares explanations of how baking with fruit works. If this doesn’t give you warm fuzzy feelings for the internet, I don’t know what will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if I am interested in anything related to craft (cooking, basket weaving) or if I feel like online exploration outside the social media ecosystem. Their rainbow</span><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘random’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button is perfect for that.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embeddings search</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLMs are also taking over internet search. There are new search engines that let you chat with the search results and even formulate new questions based on the previous search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two examples of these are Exa and Perplexity. I have discovered them only recently but use them regularly to discover material around a certain topic for my work related searches. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perplexity</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://perplexity.ai"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perplexity</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you chat with the internet. The interface is very user friendly and includes all the search results the robot is basing its answer on. But be careful here, because LLM models do hallucinate and as </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIRED reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “it falsely claimed that WIRED had reported that a specific police officer in California had committed a crime”. It is therefore more suitable for general overview questions rather than in-depth search.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">perplexity </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes you chat with the internet directly, </span><a href="https://exa.ai/search"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">returns actual search results first, that you can then chat with if you like, so resembling an actual search engine more closely. It also (automatically) alternates between keyword search and embeddings-based search depending on what you ask. This is a good call, as keyword search is </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less thirsty for resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I also like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exa’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s focus on using LLMs to return relevant search results.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://kagi.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only search engine in the list that you need to pay for - if you want to do more than 100 searches a month. In return they won’t run ads or sell your data. You can personalize their keyword search;  they also offer an AI bot feature where you can choose from a dozen LLMs . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I don’t have premium access, I use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sparingly, for the most in depth part of any research. The search results are very good and it helps me find things that I could not find using any of the other search engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is personal, and by no means exhaustive. I for example don’t use the most famous privacy oriented alternative to Google, </span><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuckDuckGO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There also exists a little army of </span><a href="https://www.are.na/elan-kiderman-ullendorff/search-engines-for-wandering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small ‘folk’ search engine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginalia. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is very much a work in progress and a living active process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet morphs and changes. Looking ahead to 2034 the internet will be at least as different from now as now is different from how things were in 2014. Therefore we need to keep our strategies for navigating it flexible too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have other search engines you use and love? I would love to hear about them!</span></p>
