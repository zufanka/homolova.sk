						- Purpose: getting *insights* from data
						- Happens in *multiple parts*
						- *Iterative process*, not linear
						---
						## Parts
						- context information collection
						- hypothesis
						- data collection
						- cleaning
						- exploratory analysis
						- creating data visualizations
						- communicating

								<blockquote>"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo* and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?"</blockquote>

								<sub>*manufactured products like metal pots, radios, umbrellas</sub>
								---
								## One question to rule them all
								---
								What is the story?
								---
								We are all *storytellers*
								---
								Each dataset can tell us a set of tales, if we ask the *right questions*.
								---
								## Interviewing data
								- Background check
								- Interview
								---
								## Background check
								- learn as much as you can about the data before analysis helps to make better questions later
								- example questions: where is the data? In what format is it? Is it machine readable? *Who made it and for what purpose?* *Is the data complete?* Is there a methodology? *What arbitrary choices had to be made to generate the data?* *What is NOT in the data?* Why? What other stories were made with the data?
								---

								---
								- collaboration of *50 journalists* from *27 countries*
								- *1200* annual financial reports & *500,000* donations
								---
								## What is the story?
								For only *three out of every 10 euros* political parties receive from individuals and companies the name of the donor is made public.
								---
								![](img/ppf2.jpg)
								---
								### Where is the data?
								- Different formats (yearly reports in scanned PDFs, websites, public offices)
								### Is it complete?
								- Different rules around disclosure (above 500, 5000 euro, none)
								---
								- boundaries on what story we could tell: this on itself was a part of the story
								---
								## Interview
								1. **Ice breakers**: descriptive statistics & *distributions*, *missing values*, unique values, counts, *outliers*
								---
								![](img/torchbearers.png)

								[source](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/06/torchbearers-nominated-olympics-sponsors)
								---
								'Throughout their descriptions of the 70-day Olympic torch relay, the London 2012 organisers talked of having tracked down *"8,000 truly inspirational people from across the UK".*
								---
								*missing values*: many torchbearers did not have a BIO
								- EDF: included the group's former director of HR and communications
								- BP selected a member of the company's North Sea leadership team
								- ArcelorMittal selected the company's founder, Lakshmi Mittal and his son Aditya, the group's chief financial officer
								---
								## Interview
								2. **Core questions**: focused on the story we want to tell, *testing our hypotheses*
								---
								### Hypothesis
								A good hypothesis formulates not only the idea, but also the means of proving it.
								---
								*'Vaccine distribution is unequal‚Äô*
								
								VS 
								
								*‚ÄòVaccines are more available for high income countries in general, and, on an individual level, for wealthy people not the poor‚Äô.*
								---
								### Good hypothesis
								- Can either be *proven or disproven with data*
								- Is *specific* about what is being measured
								- The data is *available*
								- Even if proven false, you still might have a good story
								---
								If we have a good hypothesis, questions will arise by themselves.

								---
								![](img/tennisracket5.png)
								---
								Hypothesis: professional tennis players manipulate or outright fix first-round matches in professional tournaments
								---
								![](img/nude0.png)

								[source](https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/)
								---
								![](img/nude.png)
								---
								Hypothesis: lighter foundation colors are more likely to be called 'nude'
								---
								## Interview people too!
								Data can answer different types of questions (quantitative) than humans (qualitative). For a good story we *need both*.
