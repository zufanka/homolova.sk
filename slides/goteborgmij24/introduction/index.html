---
- of *50 journalists* from *27 countries*
- *1200* annual financial reports & *500,000* individual donations
---
#### Main findings
- Most parties rely heavily on *state subsidy*
- only for *30%* of the private donations the name of the donor is made public
- *1 in 4 euros* goes to some sort of extremist or populist party

### But ...
- learning to program is *time consuming* - takes regular practice and dedication
---
### Why Python?
---
#### Simple syntax
Here's the most simple program called "Hello World"

Python:
```python
print("Hello World)
```

Java:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

C++:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
---
#### Versatile
Libraries to do scraping, data analysis, machine learning, building websites and applications, whole software.
---
#### Popular
Many resources, community and support
---
# Questions?
---
# Break
---
# Let's get to it!
---
## What do you need
- a support group
- laptop with software
- strategy
- resources
- patience
---
### Support group
- form a group of about 4 people to learn together.
- at least one person with some experience in coding
- homework is **individual**

I am a part of **every** support group - reach out!
(Signal group?)

---
### Software
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + python plugin
- (later jupyter)
---
### Strategy
- regular practice - 8 hours a week
- objective: *learn the principles*
---
#### LLMs 
- use them as personal *assistant*, to help you learn
- do **not** use them to **replace yourself**
